Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ali Ahmed, and I am a Pakistani citizen. I was born in Pakistan, grew up in Rwanda, and am currently living in Turkey. I'm currently in my last year of high school. I am extremely passionate about web development and basketball, and I have great social and leadership skills. I have a keen interest in computer science. My future prospects are either to work as a full-stack developer or software engineer for a military or arms firm, and I want to uplift the infrastructure of my community using technology.
